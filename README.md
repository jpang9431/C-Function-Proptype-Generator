This is a random thing I built while learning C. 
It works on the assumption that the { character is on the same line as a function decleration.
It also assumes that the function is written in proper function notation.
Simply put your C code with only the function you decleared (not including the main function or any other headers) in a text file and copy the path of the text file
Input the path when promoted without any " symbols
The headers will output to the console to copy and past after any struct declerations
