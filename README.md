This is a random thing I built while learning C. 
It works on the assumption that the { character is on the same line as a function decleration.
It also assumes that the function is written in proper function notation.
Simply put your C code with only the function you decleared (not including the main function or any other headers)
The headers will output to the console to copy and past after any struct declerations
